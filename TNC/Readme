TNC Notes on Use 

•	AX.25 Interface (Rizwan’s program, on ground station computer)
  o	Previous Destination Callsign: KF5BNL (7)
  o	Repeater Callsign: CQ  (0)
  o	Serial Port for Ground Station COM4
  o	Baudrate 9600
  o	Parity: None
  o	Data Bits: 8 
  o	Stop Bits: 1
  o	Use AX25 (Checked)
  o	Use Repeater Address (Checked) 
•	Usually doesn’t Work on First Try 
•	KEY_UP function
  o	Sets header: callsigns(3) & start character 
  o	Sends commands after header 
•	Receives Packets 
  o	Uses AX.25 Interface 
  o	Read serial buffer using readStringUntil(59); 
    	59 is ascii ‘;’
•	Hardware 
  o	Pins 3.3V, GRND, RX(on TNC), TX (on TNC) 
  o	RX on TNC  TX on Arduino 
•	No interrupt for Commands, will use polling in main loop (see code on GitHub)
